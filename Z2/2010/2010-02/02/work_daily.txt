2.Group Membership for Households and Organizations:
  a.Table:membership_term, add isGroupMembership,

3.Add DOB to output columns? If it takes more than an hour, let’s not worry about it. Please let me know your time estimate first before we do anything.

4.When an account gets deleted in NEON back end. If it's a recently created account and it is listed on mail merge list. Our communication home won't work.
  Can we clear mail_merge table (remove the matching accountId and constituentId records) when we delete an account?

5.I think Dan already added the Transaction ID, let's also add the Deceased field.
  #1. Allocate My Contribution is a custom field
  #2. Donation report related.
  
6.Can you help us find out why Sheila Bowman (387) is not on auto renewal (membership) any more… 
  Do you have a log file that can tell us who unchecked (AUTO) on their account? 
  Denise thinks we have more accounts that are suddenly not on auto anymore
