1.Event custom fields的问题：
  对于报表部分，在查询的Search Filter列表那里加一个checkbox，询问是否包括custom data，如果选择了，就加载所有的custom data。
  对于知道Event Id的部分，加载出具体的每个Event或者Attendee的custom data，然后再查询。

2, I’m not seeing Additional Contact as an available result column anywhere either

3, Add Company Title to the search
 
4, Add Event and Activity search tab to Mailing, Primary Contact and Stats Search

5, Is there a summary view of our saved reports where I can quickly view who created the report and when without clicking on each individual report (like there was previously)?  

6, Would it be possible to add the PDF option back into the reports tab.

7, Can’t search by Last Donation Date anymore, or at least I can’t see where to do that. This is big because people want to do searches on whose last donation was before a certain date etc. I can include the column in the results, but I can’t filter the search based on that data.

8, Since the Deceased, No Email and No Solicitation qualifiers are in the first Group now instead of as Query Filters, does that mean that any groups that get added are not going to exclude Deceased, No Email and No Solicitation accounts? In other words, if someone doing a search adds a group, are they going to have to add those filters to each group they add?

9, For some reason, if you click the calendar and select a date for Donation Date on the search criteria page, the date pops up under Expected Date instead. This happened to me and Tim Waggoner. I think we were both running Donor Reports.

10,看JIRA上的BUG.
