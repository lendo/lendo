1.fix bug NEON-283。
2.修改范围：search.xml
3.IMPROVEMENT-15:note的parentId，既可能是account.id，也可能是donation.id,我不明白，为什么下面的脚本针对97776,又有parentType=1，又有parentType=4
  经验证：parentType=1,是在accountDetail加入的note，parentType=5是在donationDetail加入的note。

注意妈的生日。

2, I’m not seeing Additional Contact as an available result column anywhere either
 
4, Add Event and Activity search tab to Mailing, Primary Contact and Stats Search

5, Is there a summary view of our saved reports where I can quickly view who created the report and when without clicking on each individual report (like there was previously)?  

6, Would it be possible to add the PDF option back into the reports tab.

8, Since the Deceased, No Email and No Solicitation qualifiers are in the first Group now instead of as Query Filters, does that mean that any groups that get added are not going to exclude Deceased, No Email and No Solicitation accounts? In other words, if someone doing a search adds a group, are they going to have to add those filters to each group they add?

9, For some reason, if you click the calendar and select a date for Donation Date on the search criteria page, the date pops up under Expected Date instead. This happened to me and Tim Waggoner. I think we were both running Donor Reports.

10,看JIRA上的BUG.
