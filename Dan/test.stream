Subject: Event Attendee List

 

Hi Lei,

 

I am trying to pull a report that will give me a list of the people who actually attended the YPS Annual Workshop (not just registered).   
I tried exporting the list from the Mark Attendance screen, but it did not include the attendance field.  
I tried running the Event Attendee Report, but it gave me everyone who registered and I could not find a way to restrict it to only those who attended.

 

What am I missing?

Thanks,
Jennifer
